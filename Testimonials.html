    <div class="a">"Your attention to detail made our stay so relaxed and comfortable. It was such a shame we had to drive back to our little flat, which is smaller than your apartment. We want to move in!"</div> 
    <div class="a">"Cosy and comfortable. We imagined we owned it and enjoyed being spoilt. Thank you."</div>

    <div class="a">"Never felt so spoilt. A perfect get away and so close to everything. We had the best bath ever!"</div> 
    <div class="a">"A few minutesâ€™ walk from the beach, picnic basket in hand and towel over the shoulder - can't think of anything better except that wonderful breakfast. That bacon is the best in Melbourne!"</div>
